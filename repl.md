### This is the Quiz Title - It is required.

Here, you can write any necessary directions for the repl.  It will be parsed as markdown, and even accepts codeblocks!

Write a `while` loop that fills the given array `tayArray` with five strings, each containing "taylors gonna tay".

Here's an example of iteration in JS:

```js
for(i=0; i<10; i++;){
  // code here
}
```

Now write your own!

The space delineated by the tildes below is used to set any initial values for the repl.  Append the name of the language you want to use, to the opening trio of tildes.

~~~javascript

var tayArray = [];
