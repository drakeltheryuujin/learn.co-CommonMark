This file should include the answers to all quizzes in a readme.

For multiple choice and multiple select:
The order number of each correct answer in the order that the questions appear in the quiz. Not the index.
For multiple select questions, the order number for each answer should be separated by commas.

For short-answer, or fill-in questions, the answer should be included in quotes "".

Each answer should be delineated by a line break.

Nothing else should be in this file except the answers.

Below are the answers for the quizzes in the quiz.md file.
